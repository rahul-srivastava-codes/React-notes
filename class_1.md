Why we need any framework?
We can simply create any kind of static (once loaded  ntng changes) websites using html, css, js
so why do we need it . Bolo bolo bolo 
React solves for issues of dynamic sites.
Know that react too converts code into html, css and js under the hood.

To get more about react try to get 2 stuff of react
<br>
<strong>(Interview question)</ strong>
<b>1) state </b>-> In React, state is a built-in object used to store and manage a component's dynamic data.
It allows components to create and maintain their own data, making the UI responsive to user interactions.
<b>2) component</b> -> In react dividing the repeating section of code into single function and then according to the value we
re render it

Return, we cannot return multiple things in react
re-rendering -> A state variable that is being used inside a component chnages, then parent componenet re-render triggers all children re-rendering

Knock knock -> 
1) In react rendering either you create a separate component to improve performance
2) use (memo) -> skips re-rendering if dom is not manipulated.
Performance is improved to a great extent
